# Portfolio Projects
TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb: Coding Language-Python
	This project is a portion of my thesis that contains Convolutional Neural Networks, Long-Short Term Memory Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit Networks, and a hybrid of the three.
 	For the project, the daily case count in the United States and Peru is predicted for 7, 15, and 30 day output seques. 
  	The predictions for all models and sequence lengths are plotted at the end of the file.

Portfolio Classification.ipynb: Coding Language-Python
	The project utilizes data pertaining to Lung Cancer with variables such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consumption, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, and chest pain.
	For the project, I perform exploratory data analysis and use SMOTE to oversample the minority class because the Lung Cancer status is imbalanced.
 	Classiciation is performed with logistic regression, K nearest neighbors, support vector machine classification, random forest, and XGBoost.
  	A summary report and ROC comparison is available at the end of the file.
