# Portfolio Projects
TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb: Coding Language-Python
	This project is a portion of my thesis that contains Convolutional Neural Networks, Long-Short Term Memory Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit Networks, and a hybrid of the three.
 	For the project, the daily case count in the United States and Peru is predicted for 7, 15, and 30 day output seques. 
  	The predictions for all models and sequence lengths are plotted at the end of the file.

Portfolio Classification.ipynb: Coding Language-Python
	The project utilizes data pertaining to Lung Cancer with variables such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consumption, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, and chest pain.
	For the project, I perform exploratory data analysis and use SMOTE to oversample the minority class because the Lung Cancer status is imbalanced.
 	Classiciation is performed with logistic regression, K nearest neighbors, support vector machine classification, random forest, and XGBoost.
  	A summary report and ROC comparison is available at the end of the file. 

RegressionProject.ipynb: Coding Language-R
	The project utilizes data pertaining to Home Sales with variables such as lot size, zoning, frontage, location, neighborhood, condition, quality, material, year built, year remodeled, and many more.
	For the project, I perform exploratory data analysis to evaluate the many numerical and categorical variables. Missing value imputation, factor collapsing, and other techniques are utilized to prepare the variables before modeling.
 	Random forest is utilized to predict the sale price of the house and variance inflation factor is plotted. 
  The model's performance is evaluated over the test set using RMSE.
